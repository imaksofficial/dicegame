# 🎲 Dice Game – A JavaScript Project

An interactive dice game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. Each time you reload the page, the dice roll randomly and the winner is declared — just like tossing real dice! This project was created as a fun and hands-on way to apply core JavaScript concepts like randomness, DOM manipulation, and logic-building.
